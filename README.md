# Box Management API

This is a backend API service built in Go, using Gorilla Mux for routing, to manage users, transactions, and boxesâ€”virtual containers for funds or items. Each user has personal details, boxes store financial data, and transactions log deposit and withdrawal activities, providing a structured system for user account and transaction management.

## Features

- **User Management**: Add, update, and delete users with unique IDs, names, and emails.
- **Box Management**: Manage virtual boxes with an ID, name, description, balance, and amount for storing funds or items.
- **Transaction Logging**: Log and retrieve transactions (deposits and withdrawals) associated with each box.
