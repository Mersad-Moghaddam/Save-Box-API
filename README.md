Box Management API
This is a backend API service built in Go, using Gorilla Mux for routing, to manage users, transactions, and boxesâ€”virtual containers for funds or items. Each user has personal details, boxes store financial data, and transactions log deposit and withdrawal activities, providing a structured system for user account and transaction management.
